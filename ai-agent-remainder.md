# AI Agent Reminder - Quiz Web App Dashboard Component

## Project Overview
This is a **beginner-style React dashboard component** for a quiz application that will be uploaded to GitHub as `quiz-web-app` repository.

## Important Notes for AI Agents

### 🎯 Component Focus
- **ONLY modify/work with the Dashboard component files**
- **DO NOT** touch regular default Vite/React files unless specifically requested
- This project prioritizes **beginner-friendly code style** over professional patterns

### 📁 Key Files to Work With
```
src/
├── Dashboard.jsx     # Main dashboard component (FOCUS HERE)
├── Dashboard.css     # Dashboard styles (FOCUS HERE)
├── index.css        # Basic body styles (minimal)
└── main.jsx         # Entry point (imports Dashboard)
```

### 🚫 Files to AVOID Modifying
- `package.json` (unless adding new dependencies)
- `vite.config.js`
- `eslint.config.js`
- `index.html`
- `assets/` folder
- Any default Vite configuration files

### 💡 Code Style Guidelines
**This project follows BEGINNER coding patterns:**
- Simple variable names (`userName`, `mathQuiz`, `showModal`)
- Basic function names (`openModal`, `closeModal`, `joinQuiz`)
- NO professional syntax or complex patterns
- NO comments in code (intentionally amateur style)
- Use emojis instead of icon libraries (🧠, 💻, 🧮, etc.)
- Simple CSS with basic properties
- Alert boxes instead of complex modals/notifications

### 🎨 Design Philosophy
- **Amateur/Beginner appearance** - should look like a student made it
- Simple color schemes
- Basic Arial font
- Minimal shadows and effects
- Straightforward layouts
- Emojis for visual elements

### 📦 Repository Structure
When uploaded to GitHub as `quiz-web-app`:
- This will be the main dashboard component
- Future updates should focus ONLY on Dashboard.jsx and Dashboard.css
- Keep the beginner-style coding approach consistent

### 🔄 Current State
- User: "Sidhu" (customized)
- Quiz titles: "Test" and "Test1" (customized by user)
- Modal functionality for joining quizzes
- Two quiz cards with basic information display

### ⚠️ Critical Reminders
1. **Maintain beginner code style** - don't make it look professional
2. **Focus only on Dashboard component** - ignore boilerplate files
3. **Keep CSS simple** - avoid complex styling
4. **Use basic React patterns** - no advanced hooks or patterns
5. **Preserve user customizations** - don't override user's changes

### 🛠️ Development Commands
```bash
npm install    # Install dependencies
npm run dev    # Start development server
npm run build  # Build for production
```

### 📝 Notes for Future Development
- Any new features should maintain the beginner-style approach
- If adding new dependencies, keep them simple and minimal
- Focus on functionality over professional appearance
- Always test that the amateur/student-like feel is preserved
